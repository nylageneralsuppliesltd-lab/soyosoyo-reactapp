# Local development
## VITE_API_URL usage:
# Leave this unset in production for auto-detection (code will choose the correct backend URL)
# Set to your local backend URL only for local development if needed
# Example for local development:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# For production, you can set:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.soyosoyosacco.com
# Or leave it unset for smart detection

# For production (when you deploy frontend)
#VITE_API_URL=https://api.soyosoyosacco.com
